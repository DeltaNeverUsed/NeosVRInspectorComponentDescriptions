# Descriptions for component fields in inspector
Plop this badboy in your ``nml_mods`` folder

This mod attaches a Dynamic Variable space called ``InspectorToolTip`` to your inspector,
which it then writes a description of the field your currently hovering over to ``InspectorToolTip/Tooltip`` Dynamic Variable.
An then you can do whatever you want with that, like put it on a dev tip.
